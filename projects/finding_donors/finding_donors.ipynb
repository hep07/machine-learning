    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).\n",

    "    It has a lot of hyperparameters to tune compared with random forest or SVM. If they are poorly tuned, the model performance can suffer. Also, sometimes to achieve good results we need a lot of iterations and when store the model, it takes a lot of memory. Similarly, when evaluating a model, we need to run through all base-learner, i.e. iterations, which can take long. Note that there are packages like XGBoost that cleverly parelle model evaluation so that it runs faster.\n",

    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    The strength of the model is the ability to go to infinite dimension space and generate flexible decision boundary without ruining the ability to generalize. Also, computation wise SVM can be formulated as a quadratic programming using dual approach, which can be solved very nicely in theory, without having to worry about local minimal like in neuron network models. In early 2000s before the age of deep learning (CNN) , when we have a lot of features and fewer data points, SVM usually outperforms neuron network due to the ability to control overfitting and fast computation. \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    First, when we have a lot of data points, SVM can take very long to train.\n",
    "    On one hand, SVM does not produce probability estimate in classification task, unlike neuron net or boosting. Also, its success mainly lies in classification. There are tricks to generalize SVM so that it work for regression problem as well but it generally does not work very well. Another thing is that the user need to pick kernel if a linear SVM is not appropriate and there is not really a good rational to that, which might be another hyperparameter to tune. Also, at current era of deep learning, more often than not, SVM is outperformed by state-of-the-art neuron network models in vision and speech tasks.     \n",

In this particular exercise, I am just using shallow network with regular fully-connected layers to make prediction since the problem at hands is not really suitable for using deep learning or convolution neuron network. Also, I did not tune the network design to find out the best one and simply use three hidden layers with (5,5,3) in each layer. The implementation I uses is MLPclassifier in sklearn.\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    The strength of the model is the ability to generate good non-linear features representation by itself with the purpose of making good prediction. That avoids the need of hand-designed features, which is time-consuming and can be inaccurate;\n",
    "    Another strength is the ability to do online learning via mini-batches and transfer learning in which we can train on small data from model architecture and weights trained from millions of images;\n",
    "    When done right has great predictive power;\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    Sensitive to featuers scaling and lots of values of lots hyperparameter like number of neurons for each layer and the number of layers;\n",
    "    In theory it is troublesome stuck at local optimal but in reality it seems that if we try enough starting points or with some optimization algorithms like adam it should be fine;\n",
    "    Similarly to SVM, another weakness is the imperfect handling of data of mixed type like this exercise. For sure we can do one hot encoding but that is not as ideal as tree algorithms.\n",
    "    In our case it is probably not as important, but in general, neuron network has big hanger for data, the more the better especially if we include a lot of paramter in our network architecture. If we do not have enough data to match the complexity of the model we specified, we have to take measures against overfitting, things like early-stop, regularizations, drop-out etc..\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "Gradient Boosting algorithms is a particular type of ensemble learning methods where we fit base-learning iteratively during training time. When the base-learner is decision tree algorithm, which is a common choice, we name the final algorithm Gradient Boosting Tree. At step n+1, a new tree is trained to improve the performance of the model by focusing on points where our model so far hasn't done very well up until step n. This way our ensemble methods will get better and better by iteratively focusing on \"hard\" examples rather than treating all data points the same. After M steps/iterations, the final model ouput would simply be a weighted sum of all M base-learners, i.e., trees, where the weights are based on the accuracy of each base-learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since in GBM, base-learner is decision tree algorithm, when training each base-learner we need to grow a decision tree. The process of growing a decision tree is like playing the 20 question game, where you can ask 20 yes or no questions to figure out the final answer. The way we grow a tree is exactly like coming up with the right questions to ask in the 20 question game. Intuitively, in the 20 question game, we want to ask the questions that eliminates the most wrong potential solutions no matter what the answer is. When growing a regression tree at each step, similarly, we want to ask one Yes or No question such that no matter what the answer is, we are much more sure about the target variable. The question can be regarding a categorical variable, say, gender, in which case would male vs. femail; or the question can be regarding a continuous variable like salary, in which case would be whether or not salary >= a particular number. We ask a series of such questions (node splitting) until we are sure enough about the target variables after knowing the answers to those questions (purity or variance at the leaf nodes). \n",

    "Well I got three of them but complete got the order wrong. Now think again, I agree that age should among the top predictors and both capital-gain and capital-loss should be on the list. About the first place bing capital-gain, it is probably because it is the most direct measure of how well a person is doing financially recently and will be highly correlated with huge financial success, which is a key to be able and willing to donate. Education level probably won't be as important since after certain level, for example master or phd will be more likely doing research or teaching at school instead of starting business, running corporates etc.. and therefore less likely to donate. I am a bit surprised to see married status here."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "In my case, the reduction is small in absolute value terms but almost on the small magnitude of the improvement I got from optimizing the hyperparamter. Probably I could've get more out of hyperparameter optimization but I certainly think that this should be done on a case-by-case analysis. If performance is key, I do not want to train the model on a subset of features but if training time is super important and the amount of performance reduction is tolerable, then Yes training on a subset of total features is the reasonable thing to do."
